Functional Testing Slack Bots
=============================

Welcome! 

This repo is used for the Spec 2019 workshop `Functional Testing Slack Bots`. 

This repo contains both the source code for the Slack Bot we are writing tests against, as well as the test starter files.

If you are attending the workshop and/or wanting to play with the tests and complete them, all you need is to follow the [README for the starterfiles]((starterfiles/README.md)).

If you want to see the source code for the bot the tests are written for, you can checkout the [README here]((bot/README.md)).
